# How to rip?

Goto a compatible webgl website and click the insert key on your keyboard and it should start downloading

> The downloaded textures may not be the correct size and you'll have to manually resize them, this is a current known limitation.

> The website might ask for permission to download multiple files, make sure you allow that! I am working on a workaround that will download it all into one big .zip file!
